# SHERYIANS-HACKATHONS – Shanz & Nikz Website Recreation

Welcome to my project! This is a **recreation of the official Shanz & Nikz website** – the lifestyle brand by **Mumbiker Nikhil** and his wife **Shanice** – built with a fresh, modern approach that aligns with today’s evolving digital expectations.

> ✨ **Original Website**: [shanzandnikz.com](https://shanzandnikz.com)

## 🌐 About the Project

This project is not just a clone it's a **reimagining** of the Shanz & Nikz brand website. I’ve maintained the core essence and identity of the original brand while updating the design and experience to reflect modern UI/UX trends.

This recreation focuses on:
- **Responsive, mobile-first design**
- **Faster load times**
- **Improved user experience (UX)**
- **Clean and scalable codebase**
- A vision for how the brand could evolve in the future

The project was part of the **Sheryians Hackathon**, where the goal was to demonstrate technical skills, creative thinking, and branding awareness.
